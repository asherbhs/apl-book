# Some Maths in Dyalog APL

## Notation and Conventions

- `⎕io←1` unless otherwise specified, since most maths starts counting at 1
- `array` `Function` `_monadicOperator` `_dyadicOperator_`
- `←→` means apl expressions are equivalent
- both apl and tmn are used
    - apl for concrete algorithms and doing work
    - tmn for abstract concepts and understanding other literature
- arrays are used liberally as sets with `∪`, `∩`, etc

## TODO

- [x] setup jupyter book
- [x] get working with dyalog kernel
- [ ] enumerative combinatorics
    - [x] implementation of the whole twelvefold way
    - [ ] write
        - [ ] simple counting problems (factorial, binomial, pascal's triangle, multinomial)
        - [ ] inclusion exclusion principle and consequences (derangements, surjections, bell numbers)
        - [ ] stars and bars
        - [ ] twelvefold way
        - [ ] catalan numbers
        - [ ] generating functions?
- [ ] graph theory
